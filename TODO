* Precisely position reference designators and avoid them getting clipped by silkscreen clipping
* Diode pads could be larger (farther away from the center)
* Enlarge the smallest reference designator and component values to 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.15 to be readable.
* Draw outlines farther from components because the silk screen got clipped
* Add tags for all the past revisions.
* Use the same GND vias everywhere and rethink their size according to the other track vias.
* Update dimensioning lines.
