* Precisely position reference designators and avoid them getting clipped by silkscreen clipping
* Add vias for inserting resistor-legged PTH LEDs at the bottom of both halves
* Display the name of all ICs
* Diode pads could be larger (farther away from the center)
* Enlarge the smallest reference designator and component values to 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.15 to be readable.
* Draw outlines farther from components because the silk screen got clipped
* Label every line segment.
