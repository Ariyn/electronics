* Leave a generous amount of space between each track, possibly by using thinner tracks where needed.
* Some tracks are very close to the edge of the boards. Route them farther.
* Wire some unused pins to GND so that further PCB revisions can use VCC to make the firmware able to detect various PCB revisions.
* Increment revision numbers and update issue dates.
