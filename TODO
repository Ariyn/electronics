* Precisely position reference designators and avoid them getting clipped by silkscreen clipping
* Add vias for inserting resistor-legged PTH LEDs at the bottom of both halves
* Display the name of all ICs
* ISP header: too small annular rings - should be at least as large as the RJ11 annular rings
* Diode pads could be larger (farther away from the center)
* 10k keyboard matrix resistors are asymmetric on the right vs left PCBs
* Enlarge the smallest reference designator and component values to 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.15 to be readable.
* Draw outlines farther from components because the silk screen got clipped
* Switch control and super labels.
