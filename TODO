* Remove the crystal and its 2 capacitors as soon as we make sure that they aren't needed.
* Add orientation marker in a unified manner inside of outside of every component where orientation is questionable.
* Feature the part number of every component where it's not obvious.
* Add testing points, so that the fully assembled inner assembly can be tested in a jig.
* Leave a generous amount of space between each track, possibly by using thinner tracks where needed.
* Some tracks are very close to the edge of the boards. Route them farther.
* Improve silk screen for maximum readability. Make sure that every relevant information is easily readable.
* Improve DFM based on manufacturer recommendations.
* Possibly rotate 10 pin ARM SWD headers by 180 degrees. It'd be more comfortable to connect LPC-Link2 then.
* Give a try to tantalum caps for the LED driver ICs because ceramic caps make some noise.
* Wire some unused pins to GND so that further PCB revisions can use VCC to make the firmware able to detect various PCB revisions.
