* Precisely position reference designators and avoid them getting clipped by silkscreen clipping
* Enlarge the smallest reference designator and component values to 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.15 to be readable.
* Draw outlines farther from components because the silk screen got clipped
* Add tags for all the past revisions.
* Update dimensioning lines.
* Check the symmetry of the components, especially diodes.
