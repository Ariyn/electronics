* Add tags for all the past revisions.
* Replace 6P4C connectors with 4P4C. Make sure that the chosen connector and the wall of the case leaves enough space for the clip so that it can be pressed. Also, 4P4C probably almost always uses reverse wiring!
* Add footprint for the optional CT05-3050-G1 reed switch.
* Replace the spring connector with a vertical PCB that uses pogo pins.
* Check the wiring of the board-to-board connectors because they didn't work on the 5.1 generation prototypes.
* Increase minimum space between tracks to at least 12 mil wherever possible.
* Move via farther from the pad of CR6 on the left main PCB.
* Redesign the pads of the vertical PCB to not interfere with the keycap stabilizer.
* Re-wrap and reposition the "Unscrew the 5 large below the keycaps and the 1 screw on the PCB" text to be more readable.
* Move the parts farther from the pins of the MX switches which are too close.
* Look into the possiblity of using larger pitch components so that we could could make our manufacturing tolerances less strict resulting in lower prices and increased yield.
