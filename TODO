* Add testing points, so that the fully assembled inner assembly can be tested in a jig.
* Leave a generous amount of space between each track, possibly by using thinner tracks where needed.
* Some tracks are very close to the edge of the boards. Route them farther.
* Improve DFM based on manufacturer recommendations.
* Give a try to tantalum caps for the LED driver ICs because ceramic caps make some noise.
* Wire some unused pins to GND so that further PCB revisions can use VCC to make the firmware able to detect various PCB revisions.
* Label every net to be easily recognizable in pcbnew.
* Reposition FFC connectors according to updates CAD data.
