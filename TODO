* Precisely position reference designators and avoid them getting clipped by silkscreen clipping
* Add vias for inserting resistor-legged PTH LEDs at the bottom of both halves
* Display the name of all ICs
* Exchange the label of R31 and R32 on the left main pcb
* ISP header: too small annular rings - should be at least as large as the RJ11 annular rings
* Diode pads could be larger (farther away from the center)
* 10k keyboard matrix resistors are asymmetric on the right vs left PCBs
* Enlarge silk screen labels (at least by 1.5x) because reference designators and component values are not fully readable
* Draw outlines farther from components because the silk screen got clipped
